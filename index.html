      <p>
        Merging intervals refers to the process of combining overlapping or adjacent intervals
        into a single interval.An interval is typically represented as a pair of values denoting 
        the start and end points along a linear scale, such as time, distance, or numerical values.
        Merging intervals is often useful in various applications such as scheduling, time management,
        and data analysis, where it helps to simplify and consolidate overlapping or adjacent time 
        periods or ranges.
      </p>
      <p>
        The intervals are represented as pairs of numbers, where the first
        number is the start of the interval and the second number is the end of
        the interval.
